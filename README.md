## Purpose of the challenge
Amazing Prime Video is a platform for streaming movies and TV shows on Amazing Prime. The team of Amazing Prime Video wants to develop an algorithm to predict which of the low budget movies being released will become popular so they can buy their streaming rights. 

The team wants a new way to develop the algorithm, so they've come with the idea to host a hackathon to reunite local coders so they can build the algorithm for the company. So for the participants, the team asked the developer to create the datasets for them using the ETL process for collecting, cleaning, and saving data.
